        <h1>1. What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h1>
        <p>Answer: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol
            that forms the foundation for communication on the World Wide Web(WWW).
            It enables the exchange of hypertext, a structured text that uses logical
            links (hyperlinks), between nodes.</p>

        <h1>2. Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?</h1>
        <p>Answer: HTTP is called as a stateless protocol because each request
            is executed independently, without any knowledge of the requests
            that were executed before it, which means once the transaction
            ends the connection between the browser and the server is also lost.</p>

        <h1>3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP</h1>
        <p>Answer: The three phases of client-server protocols are: </p>

        <p> a. The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not
            TCP). With TCP the default port, for an HTTP server on a computer, is port 80. Other ports can also be used,
            like 8000 or 8080. The URL of a page to fetch contains both the domain name, and the port number, though the
            latter can be omitted if it is 80.</p>

        <p> b. The client sends its request, and waits for the answer. A client request consists of text directives,
            separated by CRLF (carriage return, followed by line feed), divided into three blocks
            c. The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="questions-answers">
        <h1>4. Describe the parameters on a get and post request.</h1>
        <p>Answer: GET parameters (also called URL parameters or query strings) are
            used when a client, such as a browser, requests a particular resource
            from a web server using the HTTP protocol. These parameters are
            usually name-value pairs, separated by an equals sign =.
            They can be used for a variety of things, as explained below.</p>
        <p>In POST method the data is sent to the server as a package in a separate communication with the processing
            script.Data sent through POST method will not visible in the URL. It is more
            secure than GET because user-entered information is never visible in the URL
            query string or in the server logs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="questions-answers">
        <h1>5. What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</h1>
        <p>Answer: HTTP response status codes are those codes which indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been
            successfully completed.</p>
        <p>The HTTP status code 200 indicates that the request has been succeeded.</p>
        <p>The HTTP status code 404 indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="questions-answers">
        <h1>6. What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</h1>
        <p>Answer: An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece
            of data that a server sends to the user's web browser.Typically,
            it's used to tell if two requests came from the same
            browser — keeping a user logged-in, for example.
            It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
        </p>

    <div class="questions-answers">
        <h1>7. Why are cookies a security issue?</h1>
        <p>Answer: Since the data in cookies doesn't change, cookies themselves
            aren't harmful. They can't infect computers with viruses or other
            malware. However, some cyberattacks can hijack cookies and enable
            access to your browsing sessions. The danger lies in their
            ability to track individuals' browsing histories.

        <h1>8. Describe session hijacking and XSS</h1>
        <p>Answer: Session hijacking, also known as TCP session hijacking, is a
            method of taking over a web user session by surreptitiously obtaining
            the session ID and masquerading asthe authorized user. Once the user's
            session ID has been accessed, the attacker can masquerade as that
            user and do anything the user is authorized to do on the network.
            Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of injection security attack
            in which an attacker injects data, such as a malicious script,
            into content from otherwise trusted websites. Cross-site scripting
            attacks happen when an untrusted source is allowed to inject its
            own code into a web application, and that malicious code is
            included with dynamic content delivered to a victim's browser.</p>

        <h1>9. Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)</h1>
        <p>Answer: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an
            end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which
            they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social
            engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat),
            an attacker may trick the users of a web application into
            executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim
            is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user
            to perform state changing requests like transferring funds,
            changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is
            an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web
            application.</p>

        <h1>10. What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</h1>
        <p>Answer: Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate
            any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of
            resources.
            The requests are:
        <p>a. Invocations of the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch APIs</p>
        <p>b. WebGL textures</p>
        <p>c. Web Fonts (for cross-domain font usage in @font-face within CSS)</p>
        <p>d. CSS Shapes from images.</p>
        <p>e. Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using drawImage()</p>
